<h1>AIGAM Test</h1>
    <h2>Test Scope</h2>
<p>
Automatic Itinerary Generator and Map (AIGAM) is a single trip planner platform that integrates navigation 
functionalities with itinerary planning, allowing users to create, manage, and follow their travel plans more 
efficiently. This testing document recommends strategies for integration and validation testing across the 
major subsystems of AIGAM: the backend microservices, the middleware orchestration layer, and the frontend 
user interface. Functionally, the scope includes testing navigation behavior, itinerary generation and 
management, and notification behavior triggered by itinerary updates. The test plan also covers how external 
dependencies such as the AI model, mapping and weather providers, and the push notification service are 
integrated and exercised through the backend and middleware builds.
</p>

<p>
In addition to core functionality, this document addresses non-functional testing for AIGAM, focusing on 
latency, concurrency, resilience, and security as defined in the functional and non-functional requirements 
from the AIGAM project proposal. These tests ensure the system performs reliably under realistic user load, 
enforces required security guarantees, and maintains overall stability across the system’s distributed architecture.
