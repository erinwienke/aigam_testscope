<p>
    To verify that the itinerary system behaves correctly end-to-end while meeting key non-functional
    requirements, we recommend a phased integration-first approach. Phase one focuses on backend integration
    testing with external systems, covering the User, Recommendation, Itinerary, Mapping, Weather, and Notification
    services, along with the message bus, message queue, and external providers for AI, mapping, weather, and push notifications.
    Test cases BE-1 through BE-11 validate secure CRUD operations, context assembly, and AI calls, fallback behavior when primary
    providers fail, itinerary generation and event publishing, routing across multiple transport modes, caching and retry behavior
    for asynchronous jobs, and traceable logging across a full itinerary flow. This phase confirms that the backend module can orchestrate
    its dependencies reliably and that critical resilience mechanisms, such as fallback providers and retries, behave as expected
    under both normal and degraded conditions.

        Phase Two validates middleware integration between the frontend and backend, ensuring that API Gateway and Router, Request Validator,
        Data Normalizer, Cache Manager, API Integrator, and Proxy correctly route, validate, cache, and transform requests and responses.
        Test cases MW-1 through MW-15 verify the accurate routing of valid and invalid requests, the correct handling of asynchronous AI tasks,
        cache hits and misses, weather and preference mapping, validation and repair of AI responses, load balancing and failover, as well as
        the enforcement of HTTPS and timeout policies. Phase Three (FI-1 through FI-10) then verifies that the frontend user interface correctly
        presents navigation and itinerary features, including map centering, route calculation, multi-stop and multi-mode navigation, recommendations,
        itinerary creation, saving and editing, and weather-aware planning. Finally, the Validation and Full System tests (V-1 through V-19) confirm that
        the complete system meets the defined functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, concurrency, bandwidth handling, security,
        and logging. Some non-functional requirements, such as NFR-6 (downtime) and NFR-7 (RTO/RPO), are not directly testable through discrete test cases
        and would be verified instead through long-term monitoring and operational metrics.
